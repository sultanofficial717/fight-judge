An AI system for scoring boxing and MMA fights according to official judging criteria.
The project builds a full computer-vision pipeline — from raw fight footage to pose-based
action recognition — with the eventual goal of automated, rule-compliant fight scoring.

## Quick Start

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Fighter detection
detector = YOLO("hasanfaesal/fight-judge-yolov8s")
detections = detector("fight_frame.jpg")

# Pose estimation
pose_model = YOLO("hasanfaesal/fight-judge-yolov11x-pose")
poses = pose_model("fight_frame.jpg")

keypoints = poses[0].keypoints.xy     # [N, 17, 2] — pixel coordinates
confidence = poses[0].keypoints.conf  # [N, 17]    — per-keypoint confidence
boxes = poses[0].boxes.xyxy           # [N, 4]     — fighter bounding boxes
```

## Project Overview

Combat sports judging is notoriously subjective and inconsistent. This project explores
whether a pose-estimation-based AI can objectively quantify fighter output — effective
striking, aggression, ring generalship — to assist or replace human judges.

The current phase focuses on building a high-quality, labeled dataset of fighter poses
across diverse UFC matchups, and training robust detection and keypoint models as the
foundation for downstream action recognition.

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Stage 1 — Frame Extraction
  scripts/data_preparation/extract-frames.py
  └─ MP4 fight footage → JPEG frames (all frames, no sampling)

Stage 2 — Fighter Detection
  Model: YOLOv8s (finetuned) → mAP50-95: 0.984
  Dataset: MMA Fighter Detection Dataset (5,106 images, YOLO format)
  └─ Manual annotation via Roboflow, published on Mendeley Data

Stage 3 — Pose Dataset Auto-Generation  ← KEY CONTRIBUTION
  scripts/data_preparation/yolo-to-coco-bbox.py
  └─ Converts YOLO bbox labels → COCO JSON (required by mmpose)
  scripts/pose_estimation/create-pose-dataset-from-object-detection.ipynb
  └─ Runs YOLOv11x-pose on each frame, matches detections to annotated
     fighter bboxes via IoU (threshold 0.6), extracts 17 COCO keypoints
  └─ 99.7% match rate (10,155 / 10,186 fighters)

Stage 4 — Annotation Fixing
  scripts/data_preparation/fix_annotations.py
  └─ Normalizes COCO JSON output from ViTPose inference pipeline

Stage 5 — Pose Model Training
  Model: YOLO11x-pose (finetuned) → Pose mAP50-95: 0.920
  Dataset: MMA Fighter Pose Estimation Dataset (YOLO-Pose format)

Stage 6 — Visualization & Validation
  scripts/pose_estimation/visualize_pose.py
  └─ Renders YOLO-Pose labels as annotated images for quality checks

Stage 7 — Action Recognition  [PLANNED]
  └─ GCN / Transformer on multi-frame keypoint sequences
  └─ Strike classification, landing detection, scoring

Stage 8 — Scoring System  [PLANNED]
  └─ Rule-based + learned scoring engine (10-point must system)
```
